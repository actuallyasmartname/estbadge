# estbadge
Estimates a badge count for a user on a past day
# Why are some counts off?
Example: hopperkk's badge count on 2020-09-08 shows 99,983. This is most likely due to him deleting badges or some awarded dates are screwed up. If there is data that can be verified true on a day, use that data and not this program's data unless it's the same.
